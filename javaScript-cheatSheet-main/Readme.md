####  Variables

var, let, const
```js

var - can be reassigned but only accessible within a function. Variable declared using var move to the top when code is executed 

let – variable can be reassigned but not re-declared

const – more like a constant, cannot be reassigned
```
####  Data Type
var age = 23; 	//number
var x = ‘init’; 	//string
var b = 1+2+3; 	//operation
var a = true; 	//true or false statement
const PI = 3.14 	//constant number
var name = {firstName: “Sam”, lastName: ”Sal”};		//Object

####  Arrays 
```js
Var name = [“Sam”, “Ram”, “Nam”, “Sal”];
```

Array Methods
```js

concat() joins several array into one

indexOf() returns the first position at which a given element appears in an array

join() combines the element of an array into a single string and return it

lastIndexOf() gives the last index of an element in an array

push() adds a new element at the end

pop() removes the last element of an array

reverse() reverse the order of the elements in an array

shift() removes the first element of an array

unshift() adds a new element in the beginning an array

slice() pulls a copy of portion of an array into a new array

sort() sorts the elements alphabetically in an array

splice() adds the element in a specified position and way

toString() converts element to strings

valueOf() returns the primitive value of specified object
```

####  Operators

Basic Operatios
```js
+ - * /
(..) grouping operator
% modulus
++ increment
--decrement
```

Comparison Operator
```js
== equals to
=== equal value and type
!= not equal
!== not equal value and not equal type
>greater than >= greater than and equal to 
< less than <= less than equal to
```

Logical Operator
```js
&& logical and 
|| logical or
! logical not
```

Bitwise Operator
```js
& AND statement
| OR statement
~ NOT
^ XOR
<< Left shift
>> right shift
>>> zero fill right shift
```

####  Functions
```js
function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
	//what funciton does
}
```

Outputing data:
```js
alert() gives an alert output box in browser
confirm() opens up either yes/no or true/false depending upon the user click
console.log() gives the output to the browser, good for debugging
document.write() writes directly in HTML
prompt() asks user for input in a dialog box
```

####  Loops
```js
for loop
for(before loop; loop condition; loop iteration) {
	//what loop does
}

while loop 
sets condition under which a loop executes

do while loop
similar to while loop but it executes at least one time and performs the given condition after that to see if it meets it to run again

break; is used to stop and exit the cycle of execution

continue; skips the part of the execution cycle if condition is met
```

####  If-Else Statements
```js
if(condition) {
//what to do if condition is met
}
else {
//what to do if condition is not met
}
```
